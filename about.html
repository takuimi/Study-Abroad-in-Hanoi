        <h2>About This Blog</h2>
        <p>This blog is intended to document my study abroad life in Hanoi. I'll be sharing my daily activities, meals, research work, and sightseeing experiences during my stay.</p>
        <p>As part of a university research program, I am staying in Hanoi, Vietnam. I hope to learn a lot, both personally and academically, through living in a different culture. I look forward to sharing these experiences with you through this blog.</p>
        <p>In this blog, I focus on sharing information about the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily Activities:</strong> I will provide detailed accounts of my daily activities and experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Foods:</strong> I'll introduce my dining experiences and share restaurant recommendations in Hanoi.</li>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> I will summarize my research activities and achievements at the university.</li>
            <li><strong>Tourist Attractions:</strong> I'll report on tourist spots and cultural experiences in Vietnam.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Yamada, who arranged this study abroad opportunity, as well as the staff at PTIT and the students who have been so kind to me.</p>
